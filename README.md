# IoT-Summer-Experiments

### Context 
This project is being developed under the supervision of a summer internship @Software Engineering Laboratory @FEUP. 

The goal of this project is to connect 3 or 4 ESP8266 relying on communication through end-to-end MQQT queues.

These ESP8266 are to collect different types of data through their sensores and to act, (through their relayed actuactors), upon that same data

This project is meant to be iterative and incremental.

On a higher level this venture is meant to help reduce energy consuption through the use of radio communication on such devices.

Power harvesting on Potatoes will be one of the goals 

A browser based of the mesh network shall be available as well 

### Tasks/Ideas

- [ ] Set up a Mesh network foundation
- [ ] Integrate the Mesh Network with MQQT
- [ ] Explore the use of power harvesting
- [ ] Create a network web visualization
- [ ] Do small experiments with sensors/actuators
