# Docker ELK stack

Run the latest version of the ELK (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) stack with Docker and Docker Compose.

It will give you the ability to analyze any data set by using the searching/aggregation capabilities of Elasticsearch
and the visualization power of Kibana.

Based on the official Docker images:

* [elasticsearch](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch-docker)
* [logstash](https://github.com/elastic/logstash-docker)
* [kibana](https://github.com/elastic/kibana-docker)

## Requirements

### Host setup

1. Install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/community-edition#/download) version **1.10.0+**
2. Install [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) version **1.6.0+**
3. Clone this repository


## Usage

### Bringing up the stack

Start the ELK stack using `docker-compose`:

```bash
$ docker-compose up
```

You can also choose to run it in background (detached mode):

```bash
$ docker-compose up -d
```

Give Kibana about 2 minutes to initialize, then access the Kibana web UI by hitting
[http://localhost:5601](http://localhost:5601) with a web browser.

By default, the stack exposes the following ports:
* 5000: Logstash TCP input.
* 9200: Elasticsearch HTTP
* 9300: Elasticsearch TCP transport
* 5601: Kibana

**WARNING**: If you're using `boot2docker`, you must access it via the `boot2docker` IP address instead of `localhost`.

**WARNING**: If you're using *Docker Toolbox*, you must access it via the `docker-machine` IP address instead of
`localhost`.
